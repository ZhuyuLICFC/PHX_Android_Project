## 1. Repository Structure
I widely use "git branch --orphan" command to create loads of independent branches and store each project in a specific branch. Those projects are either sub-project, which inplements a specific function for the final PHX project, or test-project which is used to test some Android framework or mechanism. For each project, I will give a brief introduction here, for more detailed information such as the technical description or demo of a project, please switch to its branch and see its own readme file.<br>
Below is the basic structure of this repository:<br>
